Python scripts to perform the data analysis are given. We performed the analysis in python 3. The final results (table.csv) and all intermediary results (i.e. the formatted data and the results of simulations and analytical predictions are provided). In other words, these folders contain all the outputs that are generated by the python scripts. Details of each folder + script are as follows:

Data/Data/raw_data_and_formatting_codes/

This folder contains the data as it was obtained from the source, the paper associated with the data, and a formatting code (see below).


Data/Data/raw_data_and_formatting_codes/<study_system>/format_the_<animal>.py

These scripts take the raw data as it was downloaded from the source and create files in a format suitible for our analysis. The formatted files are created in either Data/Static_networks or Data/Temporal_networks


Data/raw_data_and_formatting_codes/Matrix_formatting.py

This is the formatting file for all data sources that come in Matrix format

%%% More info to add here %%%

heterogeneity_MSE.py

Performs the minimum total squared error estimation process for any given s vector and k vector

Make_big_table.py

Computes a variety of metrics used in the analysis and outputs them to table.csv. Should only be run after the simulations and predictions have been done.
